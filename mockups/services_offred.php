      <h1><img src="images/inner_photos/success-stories.jpg" width="169" height="312" align="right" />SERVICES OFFERED</h1>
      <p>Gord Cooke offers comprehensive consulting services to help builders, architects and remodelers continuously improve their practices to deliver high performance homes. Gord provides support from the smallest first steps to a complete change in design and construction practices. He helps you fix problems as they arise and, most importantly, before they happen.
</p>
      <p>He has helped hundreds of clients achieve the goals of building programs such as LEED for Homes, ENERGY STAR for New Homes, American Lung Association’s Health House Program, and others. </p>
      <h1>SITE ASSESSMENTS AND WORKSHOPS</h1>
      <p>As an essential complement to his training services, Gord Cooke offers interactive, on-site workshops focused on identifying key design and construction issues and creating solutions. These workshops are critical to building better homes as they provide the opportunity to bring together diverse stakeholders (site supervisors, sales staff, construction trades, etc.) to discuss key issues and challenges, and provide a forum for identifying and solving problems.
</p>
      <p>Workshops combine training seminars with construction site walk-throughs. A follow-up report outlines observations made on site, including problem areas, best practices, and a planning timeline for implementing changes. </p>
      <h1>PERFORMANCE EVALUATION & RECOMMENDATIONS</h1>
      <p><strong>Assessments
      </strong></p>
      <p>Design and construction assessments are one of the most important beginning steps to building better homes. Gord Cooke provides expert design and construction reviews to assist his clients in developing a clear picture of current practices, short and long term goals, and a roadmap to achieve these goals.        </p>
      <p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
      <p>A home is not complete unless Gord Cooke and his team ensure that it’s performing to the standard to which it was designed. Gord provides coordination of testing and diagnostic services and recommendations in order to provide an essential feedback loop on the end performance of each home. His role is to help you develop a good test plan, make sure it’s being implemented appropriately and help you understand and act on test results. </p>
      <h1>PLAN & SPECIFICATIONS REVIEW</h1>
      <p>An average home consists of 15,000 building components that are put together by over 200 different people from 14 different trades. But a home is much more than an assembly of parts. A home is an interactive system and each of its components must be designed to work together. During a plan review, Gord analyzes the following components with the “Systems Approach” in mind :</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 	Foundations</li>
        <li> Water Management Details        </li>
        <li>Walls          </li>
        <li>Roofs</li>
        <li> Insulation          </li>
        <li>Air Sealing          </li>
        <li>HVAC </li></ul>
       <p>Extensive system review, material recommendations and design assistance (followed by proper installation) ensure that each home operates as efficiently and effectively as possible. </p>
       <h1>INDOOR AIR QUALITY AUDITS</h1>
       <p>Gord Cooke and his team were among the first in Canada to complete the Canada Mortgage and Housing Indoor Air Quality Auditors training and apprenticeship program. 
</p>
       <p>This in-home investigation service, offered to homeowners in Southern Ontario, is a comprehensive investigation with a full, written report identifying opportunities for improving air quality and ensuring homeowners are breathing the best possible air in the home. The process focuses on identifying solutions that are practical and affordable. Audit services are also available for small commercial buildings so employees can enjoy a healthier environment. </p>
       <h1>SPECIALIZED AIR QUALITY TESTING</h1>
       <p>Some air quality problems are the result of complex and often hidden problems. In these cases, Gord Cooke offers, in cooperation with certified laboratories : 
</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Mold Testing           </li>
         <li>Volatile Organic Compound Testing           </li>
         <li>Combustion Products Analysis           </li>
         <li>Particulate Matter Identification           </li>
         <li>Material Testing </li></ul>
         <h1>AIR TIGHTNESS TESTING </h1>
         <p>Unwanted air leakage in and out of houses and buildings is responsible for as much as 40% of the heating bill for most homeowners. In addition, many comfort problems, building failures and mold concerns are related to air leakage. Gord Cooke has both the specialized equipment and expertise to test and solve air leakage problems in houses, duct systems and small commercial buildings in Southern Ontario. </p>
         <h1>ENERGY AUDITS AND SIMULATIONS </h1>
         <p>Gord Cooke has 15 years of experience in performance testing, energy auditing and energy simulation of houses and small commercial buildings. He is a certified R-2000 design evaluator, air tightness tester and inspector, an EnerGuide for Houses Quality Assurance contractor and an ENERGY STAR contractor. He can help builders, renovators and homeowners optimize energy use in new and existing homes.
