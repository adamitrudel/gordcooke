      <p> <strong>Technical Expertise </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>His formal background in the industry started with ventilation and HVAC systems in both residential and institutional buildings. That led him to the study of indoor air quality and he was the first person to complete the Canada Mortgage and Housing Indoor Air Quality Investigators program. He conducts audits in existing homes for homeowners with serious indoor air quality issues.
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>As a young engineer, he helped design innovative ventilation products for schools and homes and more recently has helped government agencies and manufacturers evaluate new innovative technologies for the building industry – including HVAC systems, solar, water heating options and insulation products. 
        </li>
        <li>Gord is an active Building Canada team member, helping large volume builders find cost effective solutions to improving energy efficiency
        </li></ul>
        <p><strong>Sales Experience :        </strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gord has run a successful sales agency since 1986, always concentrating on developing and growing new markets for innovative building industry products.          </li>
          <li>He relates this valuable experience when training HVAC contractors, window sales agents and especially new home sales agents on the essential sales process elements for high performance new homes and products.          </li></ul>
          <p><strong>Program Development :            </strong></p>

            <li>Gord became the interim manager of the Ontario R-2000 program, Canada’s leading housing energy efficiency program, in the early 1990’s. His experience with leading builders as their energy evaluator helped the program focus on the key elements of a new home energy efficiency program.              </li>
            <li>Gord was also the co-author of a college diploma course on building science. He worked with the college to develop both an in-house program for young students and an out-reach program for industry clients.              </li>
            <li>Since that time, he has consulted with utilities, government agencies and Standards writing committees to help them implement new programs and standards to the building industry.              </li></ul>
           <p>This wide circle of experience allows Gord to appreciate the needs of the widest possible range of clients in the building industry – from manufacturers to homeowners, building officials to trade contractors, utilities to educational institutions.
