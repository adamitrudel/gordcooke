ERRORS

 * When clicking on the FCK editor (Insert/edit link) then Browse File, it gives us and XML structure error.

EVENTS MANAGER
--------------
When creating an event, we should have a checkbox that asks if it's a Cooke Report or not.  If not checked, remove logo in listing.

Changing the date field for a "Calendar start Date and Calendar Finish Date" and same for Hours

The events section should be sorted by date "Newest to oldest" in the back-end and Front-End 

In the Titles (Green Background) we would like to remove the white line between the Description and the Logo.

The 2 following events from current date should show on the home page automatically in the "Upcoming Events"


Contact US:
We have a form on the http://www.gordcooke.com/contact-us.php page that needs to send the info to 
lindac@gordcooke.com and keep this info in the DB if possible.  
Note that there is an option (checkbox) to register to the newsletter.

Newsletter:
There is a newsletter subscription form where we would need to keep that in a general list when they want to send mass e-mailing.
I just saw this module we could probably use: http://github.com/pilu/radiant-newsletter/tree/master
# TODO: add params[:mailer][:email] to newsletters subscriber list

1- Change the Back-Office look (Login window) and internal section to 

2- Create the pages "layouts" and others in the CMS

3- Create the Navigation so we can add sections and edit the content. 

4- We would need to add the newsletter system: http://github.com/jordanbrock/campaign-monitor-ruby/tree/master  (Account API = 0173c3e3d39fcc527420284e4e8826e1) (More details on http://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/) to the system.
In the contact page, http://dev.gordcooke.com/contact-us.php when people fill up the form and check the checkbox, they get into the Newsletter system.

CampaignMonitor::CAMPAIGN_MONITOR_API_KEY = '0173c3e3d39fcc527420284e4e8826e1'
cm = CampaignMonitor.new
=> Wrong API key

5- In this page : http://dev.gordcooke.com/events.php We need a "Custom module" for them to easily add events to this page.
